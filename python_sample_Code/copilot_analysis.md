Wrote a simple function to add two numbers. After that it was suggesting me if i want to create multiply function.
I rejected the suggestion and instead asked to write unit tests and asked to run the unit tests
Then it was suggesting me if I want to create subtract function. I accepted the suggestion. 
After that it suggested me if I want to write unit tests for Subtract function. I accepted the suggestion
